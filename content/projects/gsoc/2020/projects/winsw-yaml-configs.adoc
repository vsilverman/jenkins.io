// TODO: add details here, cannot embed draft due to wrong format

On Windows machines, Jenkins master and agents can be installed as Windows Services in order to get better robustness and manageability within the system.
This is a functionality bundled into the Jenkins core directly.
When installed as a service, Jenkins uses the Windows Service Wrapper executable (.NET, written in C#) which is being configured by XML config files.
Currently, there are only a few configuration checks there (no XML Schema, limited validation, etc.),
and itâ€™s often that the service wrapper is misconfigured by Jenkins users.

In this project we propose to update Windows Service Wrapper to support YAML files as configuration inputs and to introduce better configuration validation during the service installation and startup.
Usage of YAML should simplify configuration management in Jenkins, especially when automated tools are used.
