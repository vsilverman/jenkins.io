== General questions

=== Why UI/UX?

Jenkins user experience is one of the most popular negative feedback we get from users. 
There is a wide perception that the Jenkins Web UI is dated compared to other CI/CD projects.
This is not something new, this topic was discussed multiple times at contributor summits and finally led to the creation of the link:/sigs/ux/[Jenkins UX SIG] which currently coordinates the Look&Feel improvements in Jenkins.
Our user documentation is also quite difficult to use: complex navigation on jenkins.io, a lot of user documentation still being on Wiki, etc.
All these problems create negative optics for the project and impact Jenkins adoption, and IMO there are many opportunities to improve it.
There are also a lot of newcomer-friendly and small stories which could be handled by contributors.

=== Why May 25-29?

These dates are quite close, yes. We propose these dates based on the availability of event hosts.
It also fits the Google Summer of Code timeline.
The event happens on the last week of the community bonding, and hence it would give accepted students and newcomer mentors time to be introduced to the wider Jenkins community.
It also gives more opportunities to GSoC mentors who may also want to participate.

== Committers

This section provides answers to anyone who wants to participate in Hackfest and
to submit pull requests to the Jenkins project.

=== I am new to Jenkins, how to get started?

If you are new to Jenkins,
you could start by fixing some newcomer-friendly issues which are listed on the main event page.
Jenkins project contains lots of materials about contributing to the project.
Here are some links which may help:

* link:/participate/[Participate] - landing page for newcomer contributors,
contains guidelines for code and documentation contributors
* link:/blog/2017/08/07/intro-to-plugin-development/[Plugin Development Tutorials]
* link:/doc/developer/[Developer Documentation]
* Suggested project ideas also have their documentation to help newcomers.

If you get stuck, do not hesitate to ask in the hackfest chat!

=== How do I mark my contributions?

NOTE: This section will be updated soon

=== I want to work on my plugin, is it fine?

Yes, it is fine!
Any contributions count, your role in a repository does not matter.
Just make sure you create pull requests instead of direct pushes
(hint: it's a best practice anyway if you have a CI configured for your repository).

=== How do I get reviews?

All featured project ideas are monitored by their maintainers,
and you will likely get a review soon.
Reviews in other repositories and plugins may take longer.
In case of delays, please ping us in the chat.

Unmerged pull-requests also count as contributions unless they are marked as invalid,
so merge delays won't block you from getting prizes.

== Reviewers

=== Will I get swag if I just review pull requests?

Reviewing changes is also a contribution, and sometimes it takes more time and effort than the actual patch.
We will count code review contributions if they report their contributions as documented on the hackfest page.
