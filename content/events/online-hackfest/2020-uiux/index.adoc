== What is Hackfest?

This hackfest is NOT a _hackathon_.
We do not expect participants to dedicate all their time during the event timeframe.
Instead of that, we organize it as a hop-in/hop-off event where everybody can spend as much time as they are willing to dedicate.
Spending a few days or a few hours is fine, any contributions matter regardless of their size.
Jenkins experience is not required, we have newcomer-friendly stories.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

During this hackfest, we will be organizing some online meetups and ad-hoc training sessions in different timezones.
All these sessions will be recorded and shared on our YouTube channel.
There are no mandatory events  you must attend remotely, you are welcome to join the events you are interested in.
At the end of the event we will be inviting participants to join our demo sessions or to record and upload these demos to share asynchronously.

Most active contributors will get special edition swag and other prizes, see below!
